            <strong>Juice Your Lemons</strong><br />
            Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. 
            This will help release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise,
            then squeeze out the juice by hand or with a juicer.

            Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have.

            <strong>Make a Simple Syrup</strong><br />
            It's shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved.

            <strong>Stir</strong><br />
            Pour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve</strong>
            Serve over ice. If you're feeling fancy, garnish each glass with a fresh lemon slice or a candied lemon peel.
